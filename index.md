His plan for this week is as follows( he would make some records here.

### 1.Embellishing the webpage

As you see, the main theme of the webpage is one of the templates in github, which is not that cool.

### 3.Reducing his weight

His weight reaches the peak again...

### 4.Memorizing some words

His TOEFL test has been put off, which means he has more time to 摆烂(It's wrong).
